# Spring Boot Practice Module(Starter)

 - This repository contains my initial practice work with Spring Boot, focusing on understanding the core structure, configuration, and building basic REST APIs.
 - The goal of this project is to get familiar with Spring Boot features such as controllers, dependency injection, packaging, and running a Spring-based backend application.
